HealthTracker - Basic Health Tracking
====================================================

I am trying to lose weight and be healthy.  One way to do that is to track various health related statistics:
  * weight
  * exercise
  * food intake
  * doctors appointments
  * diagnosis, medications, etc.


This application will do all of that


What it is Really for
--------------------------------------------------

In reality, this application was my first attempt at writing a WCF application.  It was a nice learning experience,
and when I pick it back up again, there are a few things I will change right off:

   * The code needs to be cleaner
   * The modules need some thought
   * The data service needs to be laid out better (I want to support both a single XML file and a database)

I halted work on this when I decided I wanted to dig into the concurrent Silverlight/WCF development a bit more as
there were aspects of that guidance that applied to what I was doing at work.  I may pick this project back up after
HomeScrum achieves a minimal amount of usefulness.
